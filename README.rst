About
=====

awacs - Amazon Web Access Control Subsystem

The awacs library allows for easier creation of AWS Access Policy
Language JSON by writing Python code to describe the AWS policies.
To facilitate catching  policy format or JSON errors early the
library has property and type checking built into the classes.

Installation
============

awacs can be installed using the pip distribution system for python by
issuing::

  $ pip install awacs

Alternatively, you can run use setup.py to install by cloning this repository
and issuing::

    # python setup.py install

Examples
========

An example to use this comes from the `AWS IAM`_ documentation.
This shows creating policy attached to an Amazon S3 bucket:

.. code-block:: python

  from awacs.aws import Action, Allow, Policy, Principal, Statement
  from awacs.iam import ARN as IAM_ARN
  from awacs.s3  import ARN as S3_ARN

  account = "123456789012"
  user = "user/Bob"

  pd = Policy(
      Version="2012-10-17",
      Id="S3-Account-Permissions",
      Statement=[
          Statement(
              Sid="1",
              Effect=Allow,
              Principal=Principal("AWS", [IAM_ARN(user, '', account)]),
              Action=[Action("s3", "*")],
              Resource=[S3_ARN("my_corporate_bucket/*"),],
          ),
      ],
  )
  print(pd.to_json())

would produce this json policy:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions", 
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Action": [
                  "s3:*"
              ], 
              "Effect": "Allow", 
              "Principal": [
                  {
                      "AWS": [
                          "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob"
                      ]
                  }
              ], 
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket/*"
              ], 
              "Sid": "1"
          }
      ], 
      "Version": "2012-10-17"
  }
